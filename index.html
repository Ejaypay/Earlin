        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Earlin Jan, an IT student at the University of Cordilleras. 
            My passion for technology drives my academic journey as I dive deep into the world of IT. Outside of my studies, I
            â€™m dedicated to staying fit and healthy, and you'll often find me at the gym, pushing my limits and enjoying a good workout. 
            I believe in balancing a rigorous academic life with personal well-being, and my commitment to fitness is a key part of that balance.</p>
